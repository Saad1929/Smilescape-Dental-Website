### Front-end Technology Stack
- **HTML** was utilised for **constructing templates and laying the foundation of the web application**, as well as **generating Django Templates** for each web page. **Django Template Tags** were used to **display information configured from the back-end**.
- **CSS and SCSS** were employed to **enhance the website's visual appeal**, giving it a **polished and modern appearance** that is both **attractive and professional**.
- **JavaScript and jQuery** were **closely integrated** to **elevate** the front-end of this web application, **incorporating modern animations** such as **smooth transitions** and **interactive mouse events**. This was done to **enhance the user experience** and create a more **engaging, modern and dynamic web application**.

### Back-end Technology Stack
- **Python** was employed as the **back-end programming language** for this web application, and the **Django Web Application framework** was utilised to develop the application. This combination allowed for **efficient server-side processing, seamless data management, and streamlined communication** between the **front-end and the back-end components of the web application**.
#### Configuring Django Emails 
- **Django's Email capabilities** were utilised to **enable users to contact the dental practice for any sort of query as well as allowing patients to book appointments**. The **back-end utilised specific Django Python functions** to **extract details from the contact and booking forms submitted through the front-end**.
#### Using SMTP4Dev (Testing)
- **SMTP4Dev** was utilised to **test the back-end configuration of the contact and booking forms**. By using **SMTP4Dev**, **comprehensive testing was conducted** to ensure that the forms and back-end data extraction were **fully functional** before **testing with different email providers**.
- To use SMTP4Dev, **Docker** was utilised with the following command: **`docker run --rm -it -p 3000:80 -p 2525:25 rnwood/smtp4dev`**. This command enabled the **containerisation of SMTP4Dev**, allowing it to **run and be accessed through specified ports for testing purposes**.

#### Using SMPT4 with Gmail
The following steps were used to connect SMTP4 with Gmail for this web application:
1. To work with SMTP4 with Gmail Email Provider, SMTP4 was downloaded using Docker and configured.
2. Settings.py was edited to allow the web application to recognsie and work with SMTP4.
Settings for Settings.py: 
SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587
TLS encryption
Authenticated  Gmail account credentials (username and application password)
3. Views.py was edited to connect to the send_mail function.

## üöÄHeroku Deployment
- Upon completion of the web application, **Heroku** was utilised to **deploy** it to the internet. This allowed the **application to be accessible and functional online**.
- A **Procfile** was created which **specifies the commands** that are **executed by Heroku when deploying the website**.
- **Settings.py** was tweaked to **enable Heroku usage**. These changes can be found in **commit 9991a5f, labelled "Heroku Settings"**.
- A **requirements.txt** file was created and the code was **pushed up to Heroku** which **deployed the web application**.
